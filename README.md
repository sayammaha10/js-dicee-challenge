# Dicee Challenge - My Web Development Progress ðŸš€  
This project is part of the **Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp** by **Dr. Angela Yu**. The **Dicee Challenge** was an exciting interactive web app where two players roll dice to determine the winner. I enhanced the original project by adding features such as rolling the dice only on page refresh and a button to manually trigger the dice roll.

## Features
- **Dice Rolls on Refresh**: The dice rolls when the page is refreshed, ensuring randomness every time.
- **Roll Dice Button**: Added a button to manually roll the dice, giving users more control over the game.
- **Dynamic Dice Results**: Updates the images and results based on the randomly generated dice numbers.
- **Responsive Layout**: Clean and minimal design, making the game accessible on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling to make the page visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dice rolling logic, random number generation, and dynamic updates.

Thank you for checking out my **Dicee Challenge** project! Iâ€™m excited to share this small game and continue my journey in web development. Your feedback and suggestions are always appreciated as I strive to learn and grow in this field!
